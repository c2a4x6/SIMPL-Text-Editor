# SIMPL Text Editor
 The SIMPL Text Editor is a basic text editor built in Java, and I originally started this project to learn the basics of Java's built-in GUI libraries along with how Java handles file management. I decided that while I was at it, I might as well use this small project to get used to git as well as Github. 
 Currently, the text editor has the ability to support different fonts, font sizes, and the ability to bold the text. The text editor also has a rudimentary encryption ability, (currently there is only support for caesar cipher encryption, but I plan to add more types) however it is currently very jainky and has some issues during repeated encryption/decryption as well as when you shift the key.
